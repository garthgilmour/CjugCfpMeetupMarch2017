# Materials for the joint CJUG CFP Meetup

This repository contains:
1. A *presentation* folder with the slides from the talk
2. A *projects* folder containing five IntelliJ projects 

The projects can be briefly described as follows:
1. Examples of Functional Programming in both Java 8 and Scala
2. A basic demo of a Reactive Spring MVC RESTful Service (using Spring 5)
3. The same service implemented via Akka HTTP and Scala
4. Demonstrations of Property Based Testing in Scala
5. A solution to the 'Poker Hands Kata' in Scala 

In other to run the projects you will require
1. The Java 8 JDK (any version over 25 is fine, the latest is 121)
2. An up to date version of IntelliJ (Community Edition is fine)
3. The Scala plug in for IntelliJ installed
4. The current version of the Scala SDK (IntelliJ can download this for you)

More detailed instructions will be provided on the night.
